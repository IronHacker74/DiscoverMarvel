#Discover Marvel

Discover Marvel is an iPhone application that uses Marvel速's API in order to give users information on characters, creators, and comics.

While the API is no longer being updated by Marvel速, this API was used to demonstrate my skills in full-stack developing iPhone applications. This ranges from setting up the design and UI/UX of the application, to working with servers and downloading information in a secure and efficient format.

Screenshots are provided, but not in order, to show what the app looks like and how things were displayed.

Any person can use this application if they go onto the [Marvel速 Developer](https://developer.marvel.com) website, create an account, and add two different txt files to the folder 'DiscoverMarvel/DiscoverMarvel'. Add one file strictly for the public key that you will name 'pubKey.txt' and one for the private key, labeled 'privKey.txt'.
